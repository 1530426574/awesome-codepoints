# Awesome Codepoints [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a curated list of codepoints, that have great (and maybe not widely known) features or are awesome in some other way.

## Standalone codepoints

## Codepoints that change other characters

* U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 - force colorful emoji
* U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 - force black-_&_-white emoji
* U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE - force adjacent characters to stick together
* U+2060 WORD JOINER - the same as U+00A0, but completely invisible. Good for writing `@font-face` on Twitter

## Record holders and extremes

* U+0000 &lt;control> - first codepoint
* U+EFFFF (_non-character_) - last (currently defined) codepoint. U+10FFFF is the ultimately last one, but it is a private use character, that is guaranteed to be never defined by Unicode.
* U+1F402 OX - shortest name
* U+FBFB ARABIC LIGATURE UIGHUR KIRGHIZ YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH ALEF MAKSURA INITIAL FORM - longest name (82 characters)
