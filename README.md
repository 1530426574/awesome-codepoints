This is a curated list of characters in Unicode, that have interesting (and
maybe not widely known) features or are awesome in some other way.

## Standalone Codepoints

* The codepoints of the Unicode blocks [Box
    Drawing](https://codepoints.net/box_drawing) (U+2500 to U+257F) and [Block
    Elements](https://codepoints.net/block_elements) (U+2580 to U+259F) cover
    most of your monospace command-line visualization needs.

* [U+2E2E](https://codepoints.net/U+2E2E) REVERSED QUESTION MARK - the “irony
    mark” to express irony/sarcasm. A useful character&#x2E2E;
* [U+D800](https://codepoints.net/U+D800) to
    [U+DFFF](https://codepoints.net/U+DFFF) - surrogate codepoints. They are
    only reserved to ease [UTF-16
    encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16).
* [U+FEFF](https://codepoints.net/U+FEFF) ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE - it’s name
    suggests, that it can be used like U+2060 WORD JOINER. And in fact the
    latter was introduced to inherit its semantics. This is because U+FEFF had
    become a special beacon called the [byte order
    mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark), that was placed on
    the beginning of some UTF-8 files. In complying software (including many
    text editors) this character is stripped from the start of a file and
    handled as metadata. In non-complying software (like the PHP interpreter)
    this leads to all sorts of fun behaviour.
* [U+FFFD](https://codepoints.net/U+FFFD) REPLACEMENT CHARACTER - when a
    character cannot be displayed (e.g., decoding an erroneous UTF-8 sequency),
    this codepoint steps into the breach.
* [U+1D455](https://codepoints.net/U+1D455) is missing. It would be an italic
    small “h”. It was not encoded, because it would be identical to the Planck
    constant ℎ ([U+210E](https://codepoints.net/U+210E)).

## Codepoints that Affect Others

* [U+00A0](https://codepoints.net/U+00A0) NO-BREAK SPACE - force adjacent
    characters to stick together. Well known as `&nbsp;` in HTML.
* [U+00AD](https://codepoints.net/U+00AD) SOFT HYPHEN - (in HTML: `&shy;`)
    like ZERO WIDTH SPACE, but show a hyphen if (and only if) a break occurs.
* [U+200B](https://codepoints.net/U+200B) ZERO WIDTH SPACE - the inverse to
    U+00A0: create no space, but allow word breaking.
* [U+200D](https://codepoints.net/U+200D) ZERO WIDTH JOINER - force adjacent
    characters to be joined together (e.g., arabic characters or supported
    emoji). Apple uses this to compose some emoji like different families.
* [U+202D](https://codepoints.net/U+202D) and
    [U+202E](https://codepoints.net/U+202E) - change the text direction.
    Relevant XKCD:

    [![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rtl.png )](https://xkcd.com/1137/)
* [U+2060](https://codepoints.net/U+2060) WORD JOINER - the same as
    U+00A0, but completely invisible. Good for writing `@font-face` on Twitter.
* [U+FE0E](https://codepoints.net/U+FE0E) VARIATION SELECTOR-15 - force
    colorful emoji.
* [U+FE0F](https://codepoints.net/U+FE0F) VARIATION SELECTOR-16 - force
    black-_&_-white emoji.
* Diacritics and combining marks: There is a [host of
    characters](https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn), that add
    to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks. Unicode
    provides a [handy FAQ](http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html) on the
    details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character, it is placed
    on top of that previous one. So, `a + ̊˚ = å`. This _may_ lead to all kinds
    of funny problems, because for some combinations there are pre-composed
    characters. Our little `å` here can also be encoded as U+00E5. You might
    note, that while this has a length of one character, the combination of `a`
    and combining ring has a length of two characters.

    Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
    [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195) on StackOverflow.
* The [Regional Indicator Symbols](https://codepoints.net/U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF)
    U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF resemble the 26 latin characters. They are used to
    create flag emoji. Since the Unicode consortium didn’t feel like getting on
    board with international politics, the solution to flags is to combine
    these 26 characters to the respective ISO code for a country. Examples:

    Country | ISO Code | Codepoints        | Emoji (if supported)
    --------|----------|-------------------|---------------------
    USA     | US       | U+1F1FA + U+1F1F8 | &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;
    Germany | DE       | U+1F1E9 + U+0F1EA | &#x1F1E9;&#x1F1EA;
    China   | CN       | U+1F1E8 + U+0F1F3 | &#x1F1E8;&#x1F1F3;

## Record Holders and Extremes

* [U+0000](https://codepoints.net/U+0000) &lt;control> - first codepoint.
* [U+EFFFF](https://codepoints.net/U+EFFFF) (_non-character_) - last (currently
    defined) codepoint. [U+10FFFF](https://codepoints.net/U+10FFFF) is the
    ultimately last one, but it is a private use character, that is guaranteed
    to be never defined by Unicode.
* [U+1F402](https://codepoints.net/U+1F402) OX - shortest name.
* [U+FBFB](https://codepoints.net/U+FBFB) ARABIC LIGATURE UIGHUR KIRGHIZ YEH
    WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH ALEF MAKSURA INITIAL FORM - longest name: 82
    characters.
* [U+FDFA](https://codepoints.net/U+FDFA) ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE
    WASALLAM - longest decomposition form: 18 characters.

## For Funsies

* [U+1680](https://codepoints.net/U+1680) OGHAM SPACE MARK - a space that looks
    like a dash. Great to bring programmers close to madness: `1 +  2 === 3`.
* [U+037E](https://codepoints.net/U+037E) GREEK QUESTION MARK - a look-alike to
    the semicolon. Also a fun way to annoy developers.
* [U+1DD2](https://codepoints.net/U+1DD2) COMBINING US ABOVE - this is the most
    romantic codepoint.
* [U+F8FF](https://codepoints.net/U+F8FF) PRIVATE USE CODEPOINT - this private
    use codepoint is rendered as Apple logo on many Apple devices.
* [U+1F574](https://codepoints.net/U+1F574) MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING -
    A rather curious character, that only made it into Unicode for its
    appearance in the Webdings font (for reasons of backwards compatibility).
* [U+1F596](https://codepoints.net/U+1F596) RAISED HAND WITH PART BETWEEN
    MIDDLE AND RING FINGERS - the Vulcan salute. Live long and prosper!
    &#x1F596;
* [U+1F918](https://codepoints.net/U+1F918) SIGN OF THE HORNS - Rock on!
    &#x1F918;
